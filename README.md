Hi there!<br>
Have you ever heard about Turkish Sign Language?<br>
<b>Well, better late than never!</b><br>

<p>
Turkish Sign Language is a pretty simple non-verbal language that doesn't really require knowledge of Turkish to learn it. But the problem with it is that it has very few published information especially in English<sup>[1]</sup>.
</p>

<p>
As far as we are concerned, this language is widely used in two countries - Cyprus and Turkey. When we say "widely used" we mean used among deaf people and their relatives because according to our rough survey <b>majority of people</b>, at least in Cyprus(North), <b>don't even know what TSL(TID) stands for</b>
</p>

<p>
Ignorance is a major issue and someone should popularise Sign Language in these countries because deaf people lack basic social needs.
They can't find friends, can't find love, can't even talk to a random person. <b>If we don't act these people may be doomed to loneliness!</b> It is not just a bunch of people there are actually 2.5 million deaf people in Turkey alone <sup>[2]</sup> that's more than the entire population of some countries.

<h3>What can we do?</h3>

<p>
Well, we need to create a simple and friendly app that people may have on their mobile phones and use on their way to school, home, pub or somewhere else with no need to be connected to wifi.
</p>

<p>
Our main goal is to make this app so informative that it will be possible to use it as the only teaching material on Turkish Sign Language.

<h3>How to start?</h3>

<p>
Clone this repository to your computer and then go to www folder and click on index.html and contemplate. For additional information on how app works and how it is converted from web app to the mobile read our wiki
</p>

<h3>Final words!</h3>
<p>
Always remember the number of lives we can touch is the most valuable asset.
